#### Likha Typeface Project ####
"Likha (pronounced lik-ha) means to create something with skill and intelligence in Filipino.
Inspired by my personal gravitation towards serif typefaces and my own cursive handwriting, Likha bridges the serif form with the cursive hand. High-contrast strokes accentuate the expressive flow of script-writing, bringing intricate flourishes that seamlessly transition into a display of sophistication and personality.

Likha will be available for purchase June 2021."
