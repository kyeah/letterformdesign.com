#### Krogg Display Typeface Project ####
Krogg Display is an experimental serif display typefaces with influences of Neoclassical & Blackletter typefaces as the foundation of the basic letterform with adding contemporary flare to the serifs. Krogg was inspired by the the vibrant culture of Atlanta, a city that is traditional and fresh, mature and youthful, southern and hip; is a city that can live harmoniously with both old and new.
