#### Ovuum Display Typeface Project ####
Ovuum Display is a high contrast serif, spinning off of traditional transitional serifs, but with a pointier twist that mixes elegance and edginess through a contemporary attitude. Derived from the latin translation of the word 'egg', this became the source of inspiration for its sharpness and slimy characteristics. Ovuum will mainly be used for header and display purposes that can span across both print and digital forms.
